	    <h3>The Meaning of Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>Responsive Design refers to web page automatic re-layout according to the resolution and scaling of devices.
            As more and more different sizes of mobile devices are added to the Internet, Responsive Design provides a 
            better visual experience for users.</p>
        <h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>   
        <p>In the early days of the Internet, the designer's work is relatively simple. People can only access the 
        Internet through desktop computers, and devices come in only a few resolutions and aspect ratios, so the
        designer can do whatever they want on one screen without worrying too much about the size of other screens.
        But now most people are using handheld mobile devices, so the website must consider responsive web design. 
        Those who are old, huge, including thousands of websites are facing a problem: respond or don't respond. 
        Web designers know from large screen to switch to smaller screen is quite troublesome. Let us imagine, if 
        the canvas becomes smaller, and the painting should remain unchanged, or if you need to delete some parts 
        of the painting, or make it adapt. For some huge websites, such as YouTube, the response web design is more 
        difficult to implement. So, they decided not to use a response design, but to build a mobile application. 
        For new websites, responsive design has become the default way of web design. </p>
        <p>With the continuous development of technology, web design trends are shifting toward performance and user 
        experience. Perhaps at some point in the future, Responsive Design will eventually be replaced by a Design
        concept that is more adaptable to user needs.</p>    
        <h3>Building web apps for different devices</h3>
    
        <p>Josh Clark described the concept of the Responsive Design, “content like water: design flexible content to 
        flow anywhere”. Responsive Design is a kind of modern web Design layout. In this way, web page layout can 
        be used to realize dynamic response to different screen sizes and resolutions. It is realized through CSS 
        Media Queries, content-based Breakpoint and other technologies, and combined with the Fluid Grids and 
        adaptive pictures or videos. Therefore, we can know that Responsive Design does not refer to a web technology,
        but includes many technologies and features of CSS and HTML.</p>
	    <p>When designing a web application, designers must consider the page to accommodate different devices. Because 
        even PC or MAC users, not all users will display the browser full screen, and it is also difficult to predict 
        the size of the browser. When building Web apps for different devices, consider the following aspects from the
         user's perspective: the same page should be comfortable on different sizes and proportions; the same page 
         should be reasonable in different resolutions.</p>
        <h3>My learning experience in the course</h3>
        <p>I learned the base knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS in the WEB222 course this semester. I installed the 
        Visual Studio Code and learned how to use it to write programs. By studying examples in class and doing 
        assignments, I am familiar with the following basic JavaScript concepts: variables, data type, functions,
        objects. JavaScript is a popular scripting language which can be inserted into an HTML page. Using JavaScript
        to handle the HTML content is a very powerful feature. For example, to achieve client-side validation we can 
        use JavaScript to validate user input. Learning this course, I can create a HTML page and knew the basic 
        concepts of HTML including document structure, elements, DOM. Styles usually kept in the external .CSS file, 
        CSS allows programmers to define how to display HTML elements. All you have to do is edit a simple CSS 
        document to change the layout and appearance of all the page. </p>
